This is a very basic script useable to proxy decks. 
It takes as input a .dek file (I got mine from cockatrice) and spits out a PDF containing the decklist minus any basic lands in the ideal format for cutting the cards up. 
It does not work if any card in the decklist has overe 99 copies.
Simply put the .dek to be proxied in the input folder and run the main file
